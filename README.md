## Project Overview
The "Delhi House Price Prediction" project is aimed at forecasting the house prices in different localities of Delhi. The main goal is to create a predictive model that can effectively forecast the house prices based on a number of significant features available in the dataset. The dataset, collected from Kaggle, has data regarding factors like house area, number of bedrooms, locality, and others. By examining these attributes, the project seeks to deliver useful insights to prospective buyers and sellers in the real estate industry.

## Data Dictionary
The project works on a dataset with 1259 rows and 11 columns, each of which corresponds to varying attributes of houses in Delhi. Below is a summary of the columns:

| Column Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Area | Square footage of the house |
| BHK | Number of bedrooms |
| Bathroom | Number of bathrooms |
| Furnishing | Furnishing status |
| Locality | Locality of the house |
| Parking | Number of parking spaces available |
| Price | Price of the house in INR |
| Status | Property's status (ready to move or under construction) |
| Transaction | Whether it's a new property or a re-sale |
| Type | Type of the property |
| Per_Sqft | Price per square foot |

## Impact
The impact of the project is two-fold. First, the project responds to the demand for precise prediction of house prices in the fluctuating real estate market of Delhi. Prospective buyers can make informed choices while buying a house using the predictions of the model. Sellers, conversely, can get an idea of equitable pricing concepts for their houses.

Secondly, by exploratory data analysis (EDA), some valuable findings have been discovered. The examination found that the prices of houses are determined by the locality, number of bedrooms, and area. Localities such as Punjabi Bagh, Lajpat Nagar, and Vasant Kunj are found to be high-end localities with higher property prices. The demand for new builder floor properties shows that buyers prefer customization and autonomy.

Using machine learning, the project utilized regression models like Decision Tree Regressor and Random Forest Regressor. The Random Forest Regressor performed better than the Decision Tree Regressor, with an outstanding accuracy of 84.98%.

In summary, the "Delhi House Price Prediction" project offers significant insights into the ever-changing real estate market of Delhi, both for buyers and sellers, as a trusted means of estimating house prices. The use of regression models in the project reflects its dedication to precision and efficiency in house price prediction, facilitating well-informed decision-making in the real estate sector.
